# Notificaway2

For those of you on Android, have you ever wanted to hide all those notifications on the upper left or move them somewhere else? Ever get distracted for ten minutes reading all your notifications, forgetting that originally you opened the phone to check the weather?

The usual solution is that you can just turn off your notifications, but if you have numerous apps you keep tabs on, it's annoying to launch them one by one to check for updates.

So I wrote an app that moves all those incoming notifications into itself and clears out the upper left corner. Whenever you need to check your notifications, you can just open Notificaway and see the list of apps vying for your attention.
